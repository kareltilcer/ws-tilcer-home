# Home — Changelog

Version history for the `home` service. Full detail lives in `PRD.md` (§10 Decisions) and the `HANDOFF*.md` set. OpenAPI versions track the API contract in `openapi.yaml`.

## v2 — 2026-07-21 (spec) · self-hosted login, widget dashboard, modular architecture

> OpenAPI **0.2.0 → 0.3.0**. Decisions **D23–D29** added; **D2** and **D16** adjusted. Triggered by two product changes from Karel.

### Headline

Two structural shifts on top of the approved four-module v1:

1. **Auth: Mode A → Mode B.** Home now hosts its **own login UI** and owns its **own session**, verifying credentials against auth BE→BE instead of redirecting to `auth.tilcer.cz`.
2. **Nástěnka becomes a widget host.** Instead of two hardcoded lists, the dashboard is a per-user arrangement of **widgets** that modules provide; each user shows/hides, reorders, and resizes them. This forces the module boundaries to become real, so the whole codebase is restructured into a **compile-time modular monolith** with each module self-contained in `backend/` and `frontend/`.

### Auth (was Mode A, §3)

- **Home hosts login + logout only** (D23). The login form posts to home; home calls auth **`POST /internal/login`** as a service client, then creates its **own session** (cookie on `home.tilcer.cz`) and caches the user's identity + roles.
- **No JWT in the browser** — the earlier per-request `/introspect` verification (v1 D2) is replaced: home authorizes each request from its **own session**, and refreshes identity/roles periodically via auth **`POST /internal/token/mint`**. `/introspect` is no longer on home's hot path. *(D2 adjusted.)*
- **Password-only** in v1 (D23): no TOTP, no Google on home. If auth returns an MFA challenge, home degrades gracefully and points the user at auth-hosted login rather than building an MFA UI.
- **Users are admin-provisioned in auth** — no self-signup on home. **Password reset stays auth-hosted** (home links out). Google OAuth, if ever used, stays auth-hosted (redirect).
- **Home is now a Mode B consumer** of auth, so it needs its own **service client bound to site `home`** (as `fin` does) — used for `/internal/login` and `/internal/token/mint`, not just introspection.
- New session concerns: home owns a **session store** + cookie, **CSRF** (double-submit) on cookie-authenticated state-changing routes, and its **own revocation** (a disabled user keeps working until the next role refresh, ≤ the refresh interval).

### Dashboard → widget host (was FR-N1–N3, §4/§7)

- **Nástěnka is a widget host** (D24). It owns no feature data; it renders **widgets** contributed by modules and stores each user's **layout**.
- **Per-user layout is server-side** (D24): which widgets are visible, their order, and their size — persisted in home's DB and synced across devices. A user can **show/hide, reorder (drag), and resize** widgets (narrow/wide).
- **v1 widget catalog** (D27): **Právě dělám** (todo — cards in `kind=now` columns across boards), **Připomínky** (events — active reminders), **Tento měsíc** (events — look-ahead upcoming events). *(No admin log widget in v1.)*
- The old FR-N1 aggregation logic **moves into module-provided widget providers**; the host fans out to visible widgets in one request (D28). Mark-done still reuses the owning module's endpoints with `meta.via="dashboard"`, and the **2000 ms press-and-hold** (D22) is preserved inside the task/reminder widgets.
- **"Active items only" (v1 D16) relaxed:** widgets define their own scope, so *Tento měsíc* legitimately looks ahead. *(D16 adjusted.)*

### Architecture: compile-time modular monolith (D25, D28)

- **Strict module boundaries.** Each module is a **self-contained backend package** (its own routes, migrations, audit actions, and widget providers) and a **frontend folder** (its page + its widgets), wired through a **central registry**. One binary, one deploy — but modules don't import each other's internals.
- **Module code identifiers stay English** (D26, per the earlier D17): `logging`, `todo`, `events`, `dashboard`, `platform`/core. UI shows Czech (Úkoly, Okno, Nástěnka).
- **Per-module migrations** (D25): each module owns its migration files, run in one Goose sequence — replaces v1's single `0001_init`.
- **Cross-module data flows through the widget-provider contract only** (D28): the dashboard host calls a registered provider interface, never a module's tables. Modules communicate through defined interfaces, not shared DB access.

### Data model (§5)

- **New:** `sessions` (home's own session store — token hash, user, UA/IP, sliding expiry, revocation) and `user_dashboard_layout` (`user_id`, `widget_key`, `visible`, `position`, `size`).
- Events/todo/logging tables unchanged in shape; now created by **per-module migrations** rather than one init.

### API (openapi 0.2.0 → 0.3.0, §6)

- **Added:** `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/session`.
- **Changed:** `GET /api/dashboard` now returns `{ layout, widgets[] }` (host fan-out), not two fixed lists. Added `GET /api/dashboard/catalog`, `PUT /api/dashboard/layout`, `GET /api/dashboard/widgets/{key}` (single-widget refresh).
- **Security schemes:** home **session cookie** + **CSRF header** on cookie-authenticated mutations; the browser no longer carries a bearer JWT.
- Todo/events/logging paths unchanged.

### Config (§9)

- **New/changed:** `HOME_AUTH_SERVICE_SECRET` now authenticates `/internal/login` + `/internal/token/mint` (not just introspect); `HOME_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` (own session sliding window, default 90); `HOME_ROLE_REFRESH_MINUTES` (how often home re-mints to refresh roles, default 15); `HOME_CSRF_*`. `AUTH_BASE_URL` now also the target of the "reset password" / MFA-fallback links.

### Design

- **New screens require a design addendum** (flagged in `HANDOFF-design.md` §v2): home-hosted **login/logout** screens, the **widget host** (grid, drag-reorder, resize, add/remove from a catalog), and the **empty/first-run** dashboard. The v1 prototype covered neither. Not blocking the backend build, but blocks the dashboard/login frontend.

### Migration from v1

v1 was a spec, never built — so there is **no data migration**. v2 supersedes v1 as the build target. Where v1 handoffs conflict with v2, **v2 wins**.

## v1 — 2026-07-21 (spec, superseded) · four modules, Mode A

Initial approved spec + design. Four modules (`logging`, `todo`, `events`, `dashboard`), Mode A auth (redirect to auth-hosted login), Nástěnka as a hardcoded two-list aggregator, single `0001_init`. Decisions D1–D22. Design prototype delivered and reviewed (five deviations; D22 press-and-hold adopted). Never implemented.
